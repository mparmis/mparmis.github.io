      <description>I joined a software company called Thoughtexchange for my second Co-op semester. Thoughtexchange has a mission to help leaders &amp;ldquo;hear from the unheard majority, not just the loudest voices&amp;rdquo;. Not only did I get a chance to work on a very interesting project and acquire a variety of new technical skills, but I also realized how working at a company that values providing equal opportunity and has created a wonderful culture of collaboration can make my work more enjoyable and purposeful.</description>

      <description>In a team of two, used hybrid classical control and Machine Learning algorithms for driving a robot in a simulated environment (Gazebo) using Robot Operating System (ROS). The live image feed from the in-simulation camera mounted on top of the robot was used to navigate the course, identify pedestrians, and read license plates.
 Built a Convolutional Neural Network with three different networks in Python to identify and read the license plates on the cars.</description>

      <description>In a team of four, fully designed, built, and tested an autonomous robot collecting and storing 6 infinity stones and managed to finish the competition as the quarter-finalist among 16 teams. The robot performed all tasks fully autonomously from its on-board computers (500+ hours of work).
   Implemented more than 2000 lines of C++ code to program the robot to perform the required tasks, including control algorithms for the drive system and the robotic arm.</description>
